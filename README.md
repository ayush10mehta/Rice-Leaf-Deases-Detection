# Rice-Leaf-Deases-Detection

## In developing countries, farming land can be much larger and farmers cannot observe each and every plant, every day. Farmers are unaware of non-native diseases. 
## The model will help them in detecting which of the diseases the rice leaf has. 
## To perform Rice diseases prediction, some basic knowledge on neural network, CNN and image processing is needed.
